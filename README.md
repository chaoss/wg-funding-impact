# Funding Impact Measurement Working Group
The CHAOSS Working Group on OSS Funding Impacts aims to develop frameworks, metrics, and methodologies for measuring and understanding the impacts of funding on open source software development. The group will bring together researchers, developers, funders, and policymakers to create practical tools and approaches for evaluating funding outcomes.

## Context
The open source community increasingly recognizes funding as critical for project sustainability, yet measuring funding impacts remains challenging. Does it make a meaningful difference in project security and sustainability? Does it contribute to healthier communities? Does it foster long-term resilience and technological diversity? This working group will bring together diverse stakeholders to develop standardized approaches for evaluating how funding influences and supports open source projects and developer communities.

## Objectives
- Develop standardized frameworks and metrics for measuring economic, social, and technological impacts of open source funding
- Create guidelines and tools to help funders and OSS projects evaluate funding outcomes
- Document and share best practices across different project types and funding models
- Build an evidence base of effective funding approaches for different contexts or needs
- Foster collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and funders
- Contribute to broader discussions about sustaining critical open source infrastructure
